Description: The aim of the neo2R is to provide simple and low level connectors
   for querying neo4j graph databases (<https://neo4j.com/>).
   The objects returned by the query functions are either lists or data.frames
   with very few post-processing.
   It allows fast processing of queries returning many records.
   And it let the user handle post-processing according to the data model
   and his needs.
